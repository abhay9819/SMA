0,Movie was WAY too long and too many flashbacks to that hearing/trial etc it killed the whole flow of the film
1,This movie is about to Ending the world in Bombs
2,üëç
3,Great job by all involved! Robert Oppenheimer was  and is truly America 's most overlooked HERO.‚ù§
4,READ THE BIBLE. OVER 4000 years ago it was written. We can‚Äôt deny it anymore
5,NAZIs? They say that Hitler was the WORST but you wanna know the Truth? We Didn't NUKE BERLIN! We NUKED JAPAN. WHY? Why Did we NUKE Them TWICE? Because Hideki Tojo was WORSE than Hitler.
6,The most amount of innocent people including women and children  killed by a weapon of mass destruction EVER. This day people are still dyeing from the genetic disorders caused by mutations from little boy and big boy. Also it saved more people than any other weapon EVER.
7,Guess who has the bigger bomb right now! Tzar bomb.
8,"‚ÄúNow, I am become Death! The destroyer of worlds!‚Äù"
9,"Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the two biggest terror attacks in history. Shame on you, America"
10,Orgins of Nuketown
11,"If the Nazi have the bomb, they will use it.... USA is a Nazi state"
12,"Absolutely NO reason to show that Oppie was a tobacco-drug addict!. Leave the deadly tobacco drug OUT of the movies!

Nobody else was shown using the deadly tobacco drug, Oppenheimer should not have been, either. Yes, unfortunately their were a number of tobacco-drug addicts back then, but people also used the restroom and THAT certainly isn't shown or even mentioned in nearly every scene, as is tobacco-drug use.

Did the CRIMINAL TOBACCO PUSHERS fund this film? Sheesh."
13,"I just finished watching and i still recall feeling the heat of that blasting of bomb I don't know how they captured this but it was great all three hours was interesting and keep you on seat this happened watching interstellar i was immersed in movie!!!
Respect to them team"
14,"I have always loved Cillian Murphy who usually plays side roles although he was the star in Breakfast on Pluto. The camera loves him and he is so good at both character acting and method acting. It was about time for him to star in an Academy award willing movie which I am sure this is, and he should win the award for best actor, not just for this movie but for the multitudes of movie roles he has performed and nailed. Also Nolan is quite a genius."
15,"I am looking forward to seeing this. I truly believe if the USA had not detonated the bomb, World War II would not have ended when it did. People who are against threat of use of such a bomb no matter what the circumstances cannot answer the age old question of how do you stop an irrational bully? It all starts from the school playground and trying to defend yourself from that horrible bully. I was far too weak and small to defend against my attacker and remembered how helpless I felt when I screamed for help and no one else would help me. Japan and Hitler were bullies and again how do you stop bullies. You will never be able to talk them out of their actions so what do you do? As long as the earth keeps producing irrational angry human beings there will always be bullies. They did what they had to do in my view. Has America stopped producing brilliant people? Based on the stupidity and utter lack of common sense of the young generation, I don't think we will see any more Einsteins or Oppenheimera."
16,This movie is boring and feels too long.
17,What a masterpiece nolan really has it
18,Christopher Nolan did it again I love this movie so good
19,"People think this the most powerful thing ever, but we have the Hydrogen Bomb which is like A THOUSAND times bigger and more power ful than this tiny explosion."
